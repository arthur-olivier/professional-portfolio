# Intro

I am a highly motivated Master's student at Oregon State University, pursuing my degree to complete my academic career from CPE Lyon in France. My areas of interest and expertise lie in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Computer Science. Currently, I am actively seeking a full-time job in the realm of Web/Mobile Development or Machine Learning.

# Currently

Throughout my time at Oregon State University, I have acquired valuable experience in collaborating with teams, managing projects, and fostering relationships with companies. My technical skills encompass a diverse range of technologies, including Python, React, and C++. While my primary focus is as a software engineer, my proficiency extends to various disciplines and technology stacks.


# Some history

- My passion for mathematics and computer science began during my college years. Immediately after obtaining my Baccalaur√©at degree, I enrolled in an engineering school where I was introduced to a wide range of subjects, such as electronics, optics, computer science, and robotics. During my third year of school, I decided to specialize in computer science, focusing primarily on big data and software design.

- In 2021, I had the privilege of interning at Siemens France, where I gained more in-depth knowledge and appreciation for machine learning. This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of artificial intelligence in today's world. Additionally, I have a keen interest in web development and mobile applications, which is why I decided to specialize in machine learning and web/mobile development during my exchange program at Oregon State University.


# Outside of Tech

- In my spare time, I enjoy skateboarding, which I have been doing for over a decade, and I continue to pursue this passion whenever I can. I am also an avid music enthusiast and DJ, honing my mixing skills for the past two years.
